# HomeAssistant - qr_doorbell entry
A QR-Code Generator for HASS video doorbell gate opening

This is a short description about a solution I created for myself in order to let AirBnb Guests inside my property only with a QR-Code. 


Requirements: 
- Video Doorbell, with camera feed in HomeAssistant (camera Entity in HASS)
- Magnetic or Automatic Gate controlled by HASS (I have tasmota-relay wired into my automatic gate which "pushes" the button for the gate to open)
